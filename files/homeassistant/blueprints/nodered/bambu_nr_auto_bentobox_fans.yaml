              Automate turning on or off your bentobox VOC filtration depending on the currently used filament.

              **Version: v1.0.0**
              [Source](https://github.com/WolfwithSword/Bambu-HomeAssistant-Flows/blob/main/files/homeassistant/blueprints/nodered/bambu_nr_auto_bentobox_fans.yaml)

              [More Information](https://www.wolfwithsword.com/bambulab-homeassistant-blueprints/)

              ### Information
              This automation will automatically turn on your bentobox air filtration while a print is active if the current filament is one of any from the configured list.
              
              It will then turn off the bentobox after the current filament is either emptied, if the print has ended for 30 seconds, or the printer goes offline.

              ## Requirements
              - [My Bambu -> HomeAssistant Integration via NodeRed](https://www.wolfwithsword.com/bambulab-to-home-assistant-nodered-configurator/)
              - Bentobox or similar setup and connected to HomeAssistant as a controllable entity (either Fan or Switch will work, must be able to turn on/off)
